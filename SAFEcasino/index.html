                        <p>An open-source protocol for gambling on the SAFE Network would spread virally, and could be integrated into new casinos around the world, allowing people to gamble and receive 100% of their winnings, without the "House" taking a cut or rigging the chances.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>First mentioned on the "<a href="https://forum.safenetwork.io/t/most-wanted-app-for-the-safe-network/1112">Most Wanted Apps</a>" discussion (author unknown), a casino app on the SAFE Network could be as simple as a single, solo app running "go-fish" or as complex as an all-in-one suite managed by the top open-source coders worldwide, as a framework for all major casinos of the world. The possibilities for completely annonymous, instant, & peer-to-peer gambling / betting are infinite on the SAFE Network.</p>

                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p>Imagine opening "<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/solitaire-minesweeper-hearts">Solitaire</a>" on your PC and earning real money when you win. That is what's possible with a protocol such as SAFEcasino. It is one large app, running at all times across the SAFE Network, with consistent rules and games available for anyone to integrate into their systems. The winnings and losings from all connected people would enter into a global pot, which is owned and operated by a machine and maths only, no corrupt humans involved. That is the only way to securely have casinos around the world; having them all running this fair system & open-source protocol.</p>

                        <h3>Launch date</h3>
                        <p>It was expected that the network would launch at the end of last year, (and this app soon after,) however an amazing new coding language came out called "<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><u>Rust</u></a>" that turned out to be perfect for the SAFE Network to be created with. So, the team decided to restart the whole network from scratch in Rust. This means we will have to wait a few more months to see the network or this app. <a href="https://github.com/dirvine/LifeStuff"><u>Follow it on Github!</u></a></font>
