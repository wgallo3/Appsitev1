                        <p>Power to the People! Democracy & government have been contorted and perversed from their pure, Greek beginnings, into the ugly, money-driven, war-hungry monsters they are today. Time to evolve.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>Many attempts use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Government">technology</a> to allow everyone to represent themselves in government have been made, but none successfully have taken over yet. This is because a network that can verify each person, fairly count and sort votes without corruption, and method of proposing bills and referendums has never existed. The SAFE Network is the first attempt at such a network, as it has all of this and more, and can allow for "<a href="https://forum.safenetwork.io/t/proof-of-unique-human/167">Proof of Human</a>" and proof of vote. This will be a straightforward but worldchanging app to code up.</p>

                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p>Giving everyone an equal platform, where every single person votes NOT ON <i>corruptible</i> PEOPLE TO REPRESENT THEM, but on the BILLS THEMSELVES, would give the world's population a sustainable and fair government. Only this <a href="http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/thepoliticalsystem/a/Direct-Democracy.htm">Direct Democracy</a>--as the Greeks originally designed--would allow people to evolve past the <a href="http://wariscrime.com/new/the-13-most-evil-us-government-human-experiments/">evil machines that run the world today</a>, and exist harmoniously among eachother. People could submit new bills online that they feel are important, make their own campaign videos for these bills, and have everyone in their local area vote on these localized law proposals, thus freeing the world and giving people the power to govern themselves forever.</p>

                        <h3>Launch date</h3>
                        <p>It was expected that the network would launch at the end of last year, (and this app soon after,) however an amazing new coding language came out called "<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><u>Rust</u></a>" that turned out to be perfect for the SAFE Network to be created with. So, the team decided to restart the whole network from scratch in Rust. This means we will have to wait a few more months to see the network or this app. <a href="https://github.com/dirvine/LifeStuff"><u>Follow it on Github!</u></a></font></p>
