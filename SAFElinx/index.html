                        <h1>Decentralized DNS</h1>
                        <p>This is simply one of the many optional DNS Apps that can coexist on the SAFE Network. The main idea is that it will let people assign <a href="https://forum.safenetwork.io/t/rfc-decentralised-naming-system-v-no-dns/5093">nicknames</a> to use as links to their favorite websites or files. Think of it as saving someone's <a href="https://forum.safenetwork.io/t/rfc-decentralised-naming-system-v-no-dns/5093/28">phone number</a>. You type the number (or, in this case, the link) and then type the nickname, "Jerry."</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>An idea that grew organically through the many deep discussions about a SAFE DNS system on the forums, the idea of a DNS being nothing more than "<a href="https://forum.safenetwork.io/t/rfc-decentralised-naming-system-v-no-dns/5093">native addresses, private client bookmarks and curated collections</a>" was laid out by user "<a href="https://forum.safenetwork.io/users/catbert/activity">catbert</a>" in September of 2015. A perfect example of a DNS system that could exist among others on SAFE, without taking over, it would prove incredibly easy to design, implement, and use. While no developers have taken this--or any DNS idea--up for designing yet, it will be an incredibly easy build once the global network is live in a few weeks.</p>

                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p>Perhaps the most feature-simple app idea to be explained in this collection, SAFElinx DNS service would be a simple app that takes the native addresses of files, (such as safe:files.user283/Dr_Seuss.epub) and allows people to give them a "nickname" link, like (safe:mybooks.DrSuess). The nickname links you make are saved in your browser or client, and you can share them with your friends. You could customize your own search engine and share your links with others, allowing information and data to spread in a very organic and natural way, with word-of-mouth replacing advertising.</p>

                        <h3>Launch date</h3>
                        <p>It was expected that the network would launch at the end of last year, (and this app soon after,) however an amazing new coding language came out called "<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><u>Rust</u></a>" that turned out to be perfect for the SAFE Network to be created with. So, the team decided to restart the whole network from scratch in Rust. This means we will have to wait a few more months to see the network or this app. <a href="https://github.com/dirvine/LifeStuff"><u>Follow it on Github!</u></a>
