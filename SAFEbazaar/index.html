                        <p>Marketplaces began as being run for the people by the people, with no large eBay or Amazon corporations in the way, taking a cut & tracking purchases. With SAFE, we will finally have the technology needed to get back to those natural ways of doing business.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>Many projects are trying to bring freedom back to our marketplace, with systems like <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://www.dashpay.io/">Darkcoin</a>, <a href="https://www.darkwallet.is/">Darkwallet</a> and <a href="https://openbazaar.org/">OpenBazaar</a> being developed by very dedicated teams. However, they all are trying to piggyback off of an internet which is inherently not secure (runs on <a href="https://thestack.com/security/2015/09/10/major-web-security-company-sought-to-conceal-that-it-ran-compromised-servers/">servers owned by other people</a>), which makes their projects very hard to create and implement. SAFEbazaar will be a simple app to create, as the SAFE Network itself provides all the annonymity, data & <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SafeCoin/">currency</a> solutions, all-in-one.</p>

                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p><i>Imagine</i> opening up an app like SAFEbazaar, and being able to buy <i>ANYTHING</i>, instantly! You are using an annonymous currency (SafeCoin), nobody can see what you are looking at or buying, and everything is free-market so prices will be as affordable as presently possible. Even better, it is an open-source trading protocol, so you don't need to pay any eBay / Amazon fees anymore, ever. This will empower everybody, and this virtual marketplace will be so much more amazing than any physical one that has existed in history...</p>

                        <h3>Launch date</h3>
                        <p>It was expected that the network would launch at the end of last year, (and this app soon after,) however an amazing new coding language came out called "<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><u>Rust</u></a>" that turned out to be perfect for the SAFE Network to be created with. So, the team decided to restart the whole network from scratch in Rust. This means we will have to wait a few more months to see the network or this app. <a href="https://github.com/dirvine/LifeStuff"><u>Follow it on Github!</u></a></font>
