                        <h1>Medical Database for all</h1>
                        <p>As healthcare and medicine turn more and more into information technologies, the need for a freely accessible and reliable database of all known medical knowledge becomes increasingly important for humanity.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>First mentioned on the "Most Wanted Apps" discussion on the community forums, the idea of SAFEmed was described and built upon by a great deal of community members. After several weeks of discussing different ideas, SAFEmed came out in first place as the "Most Wanted App" on the SAFE Network, dwarfing its competition with more than twice as many votes as the second-place idea.</p>

                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p>All data on the SAFE Network is free for everybody to access by default, which will revolutionize medicine when the cures for all curable diseases are uploaded. Incredible in itself, that effect will be further amplified as 3D Bioprinters become more mainstream, since blueprints uploaded to the Network will be able to be assembled into pills by next-gen 3D printers, allowing extremely cheap and personalized medical care to be possible in all corners of the globe.</p>

                        <h3>Launch date</h3>
                        <p>It was expected that the network would launch at the end of last year, (and this app soon after,) however an amazing new coding language came out called "<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><u>Rust</u></a>" that turned out to be perfect for the SAFE Network to be created with. So, the team decided to restart the whole network from scratch in Rust. This means we will have to wait a few more months to see the network or this app. <a href="https://github.com/dirvine/LifeStuff"><u>Follow it on Github!</u></a>
