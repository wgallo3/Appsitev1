                        <p>A special line of apps by p2p-centric forums Member "<a href="https://forum.safenetwork.io/users/faddat">faddat</a>," the Black Apps are one man's quest to personally decentralize many of the services of today's over-centralized world.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>"Faddat" described his line of apps in <a href="https://forum.safenetwork.io/t/most-wanted-app-for-the-safe-network/1112/292">this post</a> on the SAFE community forums, talk of opening a GitHub for them was made, but not officially released, and it is uncertain if they are actively being worked on. However, the powerful message of opening up land, air and sea transport to p2p services rings through, as does the message of p2p paid food delivery (with ranking systems).</p>

                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p>The ability for anyone with a boat, car or plane to deliver many of the packages and exports that need sending, and get paid instantly through the app, could have important implications for society. Also, being able to deliver food and drinks locally to people for a quick payment would be enticing to many. Rating systems would be important as well, since food and personal mail is involved; however, if people are getting a good rank, the possibility for a very fair and stable income is definitely there for them.</p>

                        <h3>Launch date</h3>
                        <p>It was expected that the network would launch at the end of last year, (and this app soon after,) however an amazing new coding language came out called "<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><u>Rust</u></a>" that turned out to be perfect for the SAFE Network to be created with. So, the team decided to restart the whole network from scratch in Rust. This means we will have to wait a few more months to see the network or this app. <a href="https://github.com/dirvine/LifeStuff"><u>Follow it on Github!</u></a></font>
