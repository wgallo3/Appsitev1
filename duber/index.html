                        <h1><font color="white">Decentralized Uber</h1>
                        <p>As the paradigm shifts from corporate capitalism to decentralized, P-2-P & self-sufficiency, apps like this become more and more powerful. Uber has seen huge success in decentralizing the taxi market (to an extent) but its limit has been reached and now it is time for Uber itself to be decentralized, even further.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>Uber was founded in 2009, and exploded very rapidly, helping the people of the world by taking power away from the taxi monopolies who deliver overpriced & disgusting service at times, and allowing people to taxi each other, making their own money in the process. However, it wasn't long until its centralized design led to Uber becoming a monopoly itself. The fees rose and rose (now it's up to 30%!), proving complete decentralization is the only step forward.</p>

                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p>An <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ptac4/can_somebody_create_a_decentralized_uber_already/">Uber-like app</a> built on SAFE could permanately fix all of the problems we are seeing with today's version of Uber. SAFE Apps are free to everyone, so all drivers wouldn't have to give a "cut" to the owner. The app's founder(s) wouldn't have to buy servers or office space, they just write the code and put it online and get paid in Safecoin by the network. And nobody's personal data is required. Also, Safecoin allows anyone to use it without bank accounrs or credit cards!</p>

                        <h3>Launch date</h3>
                        <p>It was expected that the network would launch at the end of last year, (and this app soon after,) however an amazing new coding language came out called "<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><u>Rust</u></a>" that turned out to be perfect for the SAFE Network to be created with. So, the team decided to restart the whole network from scratch in Rust. This means we will have to wait a few more months to see the network or this app. <a href="https://github.com/dirvine/LifeStuff"><u>Follow it on Github!</u></a>
