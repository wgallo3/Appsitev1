                        <h1>"Global Federated News"</h1>
                        <p>The above is a quote from MaidSafe CEO David Irvine. GFNews is  a system where there are no intermediaries controlling the news, there's only a network of equal people sharing it, viewing it, translating it, and ranking it. Biased lies will be unpopular, and voted against.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>A goal of the MaidSafe team--and especially Mr David Irvine--has been to create this network, which will allow for a completely fair and unbiased global news platform to exist. He explains it as a News app that will allow for "news to be gathered by all of the people of the world, ranked by the people, and read back to them by an avatar in their own language... I think if the Israelis and Palestinians were getting the same [unbiased] information, they wouldn't hate eachother so much." This app--along with making loads of money--would have an amazingly sustainable peacemaking effect for the planet.</p>

                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p>A type of virtual descendant of Reddit (but much more advanced & free), SAFEfeed would be a 24-hour live newsfeed of user-supplied & ranked data from all corners of the globe. It would be a nonstop collection of news, which everybody could comment on & discuss. Integration with <a href="../SAFElate/index.html">SAFElate</a>, or another instant-translation service could let people from rural China discuss events with Hindi speakers in India, seamlessly. Crowd-sourced translation could earn people money for submission of translations, and would allow everybody--regardless of native tounge--to receive the exact same objective news data as everyone else.</p>

                        <h3>Launch date</h3>
                        <p>It was expected that the network would launch at the end of last year, (and this app soon after,) however an amazing new coding language came out called "<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><u>Rust</u></a>" that turned out to be perfect for the SAFE Network to be created with. So, the team decided to restart the whole network from scratch in Rust. This means we will have to wait a few more months to see the network or this app. <a href="https://github.com/dirvine/LifeStuff"><u>Follow it on Github!</u></a>
