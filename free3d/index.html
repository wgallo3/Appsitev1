                        <h1>3D Models for 3D Printing</h1>
                        <p>3D printing has been revolutionizing global manufacturing since its inception, and it's only getting started. Not long, we will have the technology to print out <a href="http://iq.intel.com/future-of-fabrics-folding-into-tech/">clothes</a>, <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/3d-food-printers-how-they-could-change-what-you-eat/">food</a>, <a href="http://singularityhub.com/2015/08/14/first-3d-printed-drug-ushers-in-era-of-downloadable-medicine/">medicine</a>, and even <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/the-printed-organs-coming-to-a-body-near-you-1.17320">replacement human organs</a>. This app will allow everyone to download designs for all of this and more for free. Just buy the materials.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>3D blueprints are a new type of information, one made popular by 3D games, 3D movies and now with 3D printing. There are some <a href="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/">free 3D models you can download today</a>, but most others are locked under copyright and IP laws, so you'd have to give up a good deal of money to use them. An app like FREE3D could be put on the SAFE Network, which holds all of the 3D models that have ever been created, and lets everyone download them for free. Furthermore, it pays the creators of the models instantly with SafeCoin, based on popularity. <a href="http://www.sketchup.com/">Draw up a sculpture</a>, upload it, & watch the money roll in ;)</p>

                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p>A clearly organized & searchable list of all 3D models available on the whole SAFE internet is the most important feature of this app. Categories for everything, from <a href="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=e0360aa9f27671b934e0ecf03dec6f26">cartoon characters</a> to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jul/21/chemputer-that-prints-out-drugs">chemically-precise medicine</a> blueprints, to <a href="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=2d5c658b28782b68a6d78a3632cd2285">architect-quality renderings of buildings</a>, everything needs to be sorted in a visually appealing way. Other fun features involve a way to donate directly to the content creator so they can make more models, or perhaps even a <a href="http://www.3drad.com/">do-it-yourself game creator</a>, that helps you make simple games from selected character models.</p>

                        <h3>Launch date</h3>
                        <p>It was expected that the network would launch at the end of last year, (and this app soon after,) however an amazing new coding language came out called "<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/"><u>Rust</u></a>" that turned out to be perfect for the SAFE Network to be created with. So, the team decided to restart the whole network from scratch in Rust. This means we will have to wait a few more months to see the network or this app. <a href="https://github.com/dirvine/LifeStuff"><u>Follow it on Github!</u></a>
